## The Solving Problem Process: Low-cost Pet Feeder System

As a part of Assessment this assignment requires use *The Solving Problem Proess* to design a system that is able to dispense food to pets and also notify the operator about unconsumed food. The primary stakeholder for the system is a local shelter Owner/Staff as the requirement specifies that this solution is for a shelter. However, this system can be helpful for any household where the owners have to leave their pets at home for a longer period.

## Solution

The solution is proposed with use of a _Servo motor_ as mentioned in the task and _LED_ as an Alert signal. The components can me modified to make use of any other hardware as at the end of the day it is a circuit and the power souerce is electricity which uses _High_ and _Low_ signals.

The Alert module of the system is connected to the circuit so power on if a _Low(0)_ signal is passed.

## Future Scopes

There are various ways of improving the system from both hardware as well as software level prespective. For most hardware level changes there are respective software changes to be made. such as type of servo motor used in the system might be different as rotation of all servo motors are not controllable which may result in excess or less food being dispensed.

- Addition of mic/speaker to provide instruction to a pet from remote location
- Mobile App integration for monitoring and notification purposes
- Sensor to monitor the surrounding of the feeder to assess the scenario remotely like temperatute
